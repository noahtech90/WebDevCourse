<!-- Primitive Types:

== Tests if two values are equal regardless of data type

=== Holds type condition as well

Truthy Falsyness
All values considered true except for null, False, 0, undefined, NaN, ""

Don't use type of for an array

Slice: Grab an index within an array
Splice: changes the contents of an array

Sort by default sorts by the UTF-16 values (You will get caught offguard if expecting different functionality)

Array Equality: === will not work for arrays that look like they should equal
                no limit to potential for memory space in array

Using const is commonly used for an array
    - const cares about the referennce not the contents
    - can edit array with no issue

Nested Arrays: It's a thing
