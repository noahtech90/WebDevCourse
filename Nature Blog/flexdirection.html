        <h1>Some Hikes</h1>
        <p id="descript">A brief assortment of some hikes I have enjoyed in no particular order</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-link">
        <h2>Hood</h2><img src="hood.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Beautiful winter hike, crunching snow and a frigid chill. Incredible view of Mount Hood through the trees</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-link">
        <h2>Olympic Lake</h2><img src="lake.jpg" alt="">
        <p>After failing to drive up the road to Olympic National Park (apparently it's dangerous to drive on frozen
            roads), we
            were able to find a wonderful hike up to a lake.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-link">
        <h2>The Gorge</h2><img src="landscape.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Carved by the columbia river, The Gorge is one of the most beatiful areas I've come across in my travels.
            Endless waterfalls, hikes, and magnificent mountains are just some of the features of this
            beautiful area</p>
    </div>

    <div class="photo-link">
        <h2>Bridges</h2><img src="bridge.jpg" alt="">
        <p>A handcrafted bridge up to the lake pictured above. Incredibly fun to walk across</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-link">
        <h2>River</h2><img src="river.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Just 20 minutes from our apartment. This picture does little justice to depict the majesty of this river.
            Easy to access and a stunning site</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-link">
        <h2>Flowers</h2><img src="helen-flowers.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The desctructive force of Mount St Helens left a desolate, almost moon like landscape in its wake. Years
            later, flowers and strawberries bloom in the rich soils nourished by volcanic ash</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-link">
        <h2>High Desert Falls</h2><img src="east-washington-falls.jpg" alt="">
        <p>In eastern Washington you will find a vast landscape, sparsley vegated except for agrigcultural crops and
            shrubs. Pullman falls is a
            must see if you are in the area </p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-link">
        <h2>Helen Rivers</h2><img src="helen-river.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The most prestine shades of blue I have ever seen. As you walk closer and closer to the Helen the waters
            surrounding the area falls in your sight</p>
    </div>
    <div class="photo-link">
        <h2>Silver Star Mountain</h2><img src="siver-star.jpg" alt="">
        <p>A tough hike, but the view from the top is well worth the work. Hood, Helens, Adams, and more that I
            cannot name at this point surround you from all sides at Silver Star Mountain's peak.</p>
    </div>
